# csgodemos

Predict the outcome of rounds of CSGO, using pro game demo files as training data. Then hopefully we can record a demofile of a currently running GOTV stream, and provide real-time predictions.

For GOTV streams -> demo files see: https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx/issues/199 and https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Broadcast#Receiving_Gameplay_Data_from_the_Server

This nodejs server could look for the demo file as it's being created, and provide the user with the feedback?
